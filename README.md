# Metrics Bot
A discord bot, made using the discord.py package, that scans all the messages in your server, and calculates useful metrics like Daily Active Users, Weekly Active Users, number of messages sent each day, and more!

### Usage
After adding the bot to your server,  view the metrics by sending `$metrics <limit> <start-date>` in any channel (where limit is the total number of messages to scan and start-date [YYYY-mm-dd] is date from which the weekly metrics has to be calculated).


The bot is hosted on [heroku](https://discord-metrics-bot.herokuapp.com/).
